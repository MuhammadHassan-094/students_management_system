# Student Management System (C++ – CLI Based)

A simple yet effective command-line **Student Management System** built in C++.  
This project is designed with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles while keeping things beginner-friendly.  
It avoids advanced libraries like `vector` and focuses on learning core concepts, arrays, and CRUD operations.

This project created as part of my **First Semester coursework**
