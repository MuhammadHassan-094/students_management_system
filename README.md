📚 Student Management System (C++ - CLI Based)
A simple Command Line Interface (CLI) based Student Management System written in C++ using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
This project demonstrates how to build a small-scale system for managing student records without using advanced libraries like vector, keeping it 
beginner-friendly yet structured.

✨ Features
➕ Add new student records
📋 Display all student records
✏️ Update student information
❌ Delete student record
🔍 Search student by Roll Number
💾 Stores records in a fixed-size array

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: C++
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
